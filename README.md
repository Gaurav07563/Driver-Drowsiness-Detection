# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
It is used to detect yawning and closed eye implemented using DLIB and OPENCV

# Overview of the Problem
Drivers who transport the cargo and heavy materials over long distances during day and night time, they often suffer from lack of sleep. fatigue and drowsiness are some of the leading causes of major accidents on Highways. The automobile industries are working on some technologies that can detect the drowsiness and alert the driver about it.
In this project, we are going to build a Sleep Sensing and Alerting System for Drivers using Raspberry Pi, OpenCV, and Pi camera module. The basic purpose of this system is to track the driver’s facial condition and eye movements and if the driver is feeling drowsy, then the system will trigger a warning message. 

# Objectives of the project
* The basic purpose of this system is to track the driver’s facial condition and eye movements and if the driver is feeling drowsy, then the system will trigger a warning message. 
* Fatigue and drowsiness are some of the leading causes of major accidents on Highways.
* So we need to build a Sleep Sensing and Alerting System for Drivers using Raspberry Pi,OpenCV, Pi camera module.
* In this project our main focus will be on driver’s facial expressions like yawning, blinking, and duration of eye closure.
* If the monitor detects any symptoms for drowsiness, then the vehicle should stop and water is sprinkled on the driver so that it may prevent accidents. 
# Requirements
* Python
* Open cv
* Dlib
* Scipy
* Numpy
* Imutils
* In driverdrowsy.py under prediction path replace the path of shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat
